The goal of this project is to transparently allow JDBC code run against a SPARQL endpoint. Ultimately, any operations that make sense in SPARQL and RDF should be possible through this API. This will allow anyone familiar with JDBC to easily interface with SPARQL, or to use JDBC tools to communicate with a SPARQL endpoint.""");

In addition to the core functionality, JWPL allows access to Wikipedia's edit history with the Wikipedia Revision Toolkit.

Features of the Wikipedia Revision Toolkit:

    Tools for reconstructing past states of Wikipedia (TimeMachine)
    Efficient access to all article revisions (RevisionMachine)
    Dedicated revision storage format");
